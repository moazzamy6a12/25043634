## 📝 Assessment 2 Description  

**Escape the Dungeon** is a minimal, randomized adventure game built using **Python** and **Tkinter**.  
This project demonstrates the core mechanics of a classic dungeon crawler:  
- Randomized map generation  
- Item collection  
- Simple combat logic  
- Grid-based movement  

All presented within a graphical user interface (GUI).  

The challenge is simple: **navigate a 4x3 dungeon grid and find the Exit** — but beware of the Monster that lurks within!

---

## ✨ Features  

### 🧭 Randomized Layout  
Every new game generates a unique 3x3 dungeon grid. The **Exit**, **Sword**, and **Monster** locations are shuffled each time you play.

### 💀 Survival Puzzle  
A deadly **Monster** hides somewhere in the dungeon.  
You must find the **Sword** before encountering it — facing the beast unarmed means **game over**!

### 🗺️ Simple GUI Map  
A real-time **3x3 map** visually displays explored rooms.  
Your **current location** is highlighted, making navigation intuitive.

### 🧰 Item Management  
Items discovered in rooms can be picked up and tracked in your **inventory** display.

### 🎮 Intuitive Controls  
Movement is handled through directional buttons:  
**North**, **South**, **East**, and **West**.

## 🕹️ How to Play  

1. **Start:** Begin in the **Cell** (the starting room).  
2. **Move:** Use the directional buttons to travel between adjacent rooms.  
3. **Explore:** Search for rooms containing items and collect them with **“Pick Up Item.”**  
4. **Survive:** Avoid the Monster unless you have the Sword in your inventory.  
5. **Escape:** Find the **Exit room** to win and secure your freedom!
