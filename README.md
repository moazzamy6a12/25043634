**Assessment 2 Description**

Escape the Dungeon is a minimal, randomized adventure game built using Python and Tkinter. This project demonstrates the core mechanics of a classic dungeon crawler: randomized map generation, item collection, simple combat logic, and grid-based movement, all presented within a graphical user interface (GUI).

The game challenges the player to navigate a small 3x3 dungeon grid to find the Exit.

**Features**

Randomized Layout: Every new game features a uniquely generated 3x3 dungeon grid. The locations of the Exit, the essential item (Sword), and the threat (Monster) are shuffled each time you play.

Survival Puzzle: The dungeon holds a deadly Monster. The player must strategically explore the rooms to find the Sword before encountering the Monster, as confronting the beast unarmed results in a game over.

Simple GUI Map: A real-time 3x3 map is displayed, allowing players to visually track their progress and see which rooms they have discovered. The current room is highlighted for easy navigation.

Item Management: Players can pick up items found in rooms, which are tracked in the inventory display.

Intuitive Controls: Movement is handled easily with North, South, East, and West directional buttons.

**How to Play**

Start: You begin in the Cell (the starting room).

Move: Use the directional buttons (North, South, East, West) to move between adjacent rooms.

Explore: Look for rooms containing an item, which you can collect using the "Pick Up Item" button.

Survive: Be cautious! If you move into a room with a Monster, you must have the Sword in your inventory to survive.

Escape: The goal is to reach the Exit room and secure your freedom.

**Technology**

**Language: Python

GUI Library: Tkinter (standard library)

Core Concept: Grid-based navigation and object-oriented room/item placement.**
